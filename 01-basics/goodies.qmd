## LIKE for fixed length wildcards

When using the LIKE statement in a WHERE clause, `*` defines any number of characters. `_` defines a single character. For example, `WHERE name LIKE '_ake'` would capture *Jake* but not *Drake*.

## UNION

UNION and UNION ALL are different - UNION does an implicit DISTINCT after appending the tables, UNION ALL does not.
