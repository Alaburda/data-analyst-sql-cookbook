## dbt incremental models should be configured VERY differently from official documentation

dbt Labs suggests adding a subquery to first select the max date or id from the current table and then pass the value onto the query. However, this results in a dynamic query - in some cases, the query engine does not know the value to filter on beforehand and may opt for a full table scan anyway. In essence, incremental loading can be computationally the same to a full query!

[Here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75818399)'s the solution:

```{sql}
#| eval: false

{% if is_incremental() %}
  {%- call statement('state', fetch_result=True) -%}

    select max(load_date) from {{ this }}

  {%- endcall -%}

  {%- set prev_max_date = state['data'][0][0] -%}
{% endif %}

select * from {{ source('huge_table') }}
{% if is_incremental() %}
    where load_date >= DATE prev_max_date
{% endif %}

```
