# Ragged Depth Hierarchies

Companies have layers. A business line probably has their own division that has multiple departaments which have multiple units and so on. As long as the layers are fixed, life is great: you can simply model this as a wide table. However, reality resists simplicity: some unit probably reports directly to the head of division or maybe subunits exist in some departments but don't exist in others. Hierarchies come in all shapes and sizes.
