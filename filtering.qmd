Everyone starts out with filtering using the WHERE clause but there's more to it than just specifying columns and their conditions.   

# Anti joins

Anti joins are a type of join where you return only rows that do not match any row in a given table. For example, let's say you have users who have done one time purchases but who have no subscription service. You want to send a marketing email to users who don't have a subscription service yet but have done a one time purchase.

```{.sql .interactive .subscribers}


```

# Filtering on the ON clause
