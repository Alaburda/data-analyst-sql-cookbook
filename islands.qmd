title: "Creating Intervals"
---

Whatever industry you're in, you likely have fact data with timestamps that need to be collected into intervals.

# Consecutive dates

# Dates with gaps no larger than specified 

# Grouping consecutive statuses

```{.sql .interactive .islands}

           with tmp as (
           select
           *,
           row_number() over (order by Date) as row_rank,
           row_number() over (partition by status order by Date) as rank,
           row_number() over (order by Date)-row_number() over (partition by status order by Date) as rank_diff
           from data order by Date)
           select rank_diff, min(Date), max(Date) from tmp
           group by status, rank_diff

```

# Overlapping date ranges

```{.sql .interactive .islands}

SELECT
 *,
 CASE WHEN Grouping.PreviousEndDate < StartDate THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS WAT,
 CASE WHEN Grouping.PreviousEndDate >= StartDate THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS IslandStartInd,
 SUM (CASE WHEN Grouping.PreviousEndDate >= StartDate THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) OVER (ORDER BY Grouping.RN) AS IslandId
FROM
 (SELECT
  ROW_NUMBER () OVER (ORDER BY Name, StartDate, EndDate) AS RN,
  Name,
  StartDate,
  EndDate,
  MAX(EndDate) OVER (PARTITION BY Name ORDER BY StartDate, EndDate ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING) AS PreviousEndDate,
 FROM
  OverlappingDateRanges) Grouping

```
